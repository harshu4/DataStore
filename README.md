Sample-Data-StoreApp

Originally develop back when I was learning Electron ,

Its is a very simple app for storing and retrieving data , uses pouchdb to store
data on the host machine , as of now the app has no constraints set you can modify them at your will

So to get the app started execute the following commands

npmm install
electron main.js
